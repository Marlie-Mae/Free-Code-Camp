            C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is part of the .NET framework and is designed for building a variety of applications, including web, mobile, and desktop applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            C# provides a rich set of features, including strong type checking, garbage collection, and support for both imperative and functional programming paradigms. Its syntax is similar to that of other C-based languages, making it relatively easy to learn for developers familiar with C, C++, or Java.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              C# extends the core language by providing a robust set of libraries and frameworks that enhance application development. For example, C# allows developers to create applications that interact with the .NET framework, manage data through Entity Framework, and utilize various APIs for web and desktop applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              C# also supports server-side programming, allowing developers to build applications that can communicate with databases, manage user sessions, and handle file operations. Frameworks like ASP.NET enable developers to create dynamic web applications that can process user requests and serve responses efficiently.
            </li>

        <article>
          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A general understanding of programming concepts and paradigms.</li>
            <li>Familiarity with object-oriented programming principles.</li>
            <li>Some experience with a programming language, preferably C or Java.</li>

        <header>C# and Java</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            While C# and Java share similarities in syntax and design principles, they differ in many aspects. C# was developed specifically for the Windows platform and integrates seamlessly with the .NET framework, while Java is platform-independent and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
          </p>
          <p>
            C# supports advanced features like properties, events, and delegates, which do not exist in Java in the same form. Additionally, C# has features like LINQ (Language Integrated Query) and async/await for asynchronous programming, enhancing its capabilities.

      <section class="main-section" id ="Hello_world">
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <article>
          To get started with writing C#, you can create a simple console application and write your first "Hello world" C# code:
          <code>
            using System; 
            class Program { 
                static void Main() { 
                    Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!"); 
                } 
            }
          </code>
          Run this code in your C# environment to see the output!
        </article>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          In C#, variables are used to store data that can be changed during program execution. Variable names must follow specific rules, starting with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores.
        </p>
        <p>
          C# is case-sensitive, meaning that "variable" and "Variable" would be considered two different identifiers.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <article>
          You can declare a variable in several ways:
          <p>
            Using the var keyword for type inference. For example, <code>var x = 42;</code> automatically infers that x is of type int.
          </p>
          <p>
            Explicitly specifying the type. For example, <code>int y = 13;</code> declares y as an integer.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In C#, variables declared within a method are local to that method, while those declared outside are accessible throughout the class. Understanding scope is essential to avoid unintended behavior in your programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables can be declared with different access modifiers (public, private, protected) to control their visibility.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
        <header>Global variables</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In C#, global variables can be declared using static fields within a class. These variables are accessible from any method in that class but should be used sparingly to maintain code clarity.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            You can create a read-only constant with the const keyword in C#. The identifier must start with a letter or underscore and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
          </p>
          <code>const double PI = 3.14;</code>
          <p>
            A constant must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be changed afterward.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
        <header>Data types</header>
        <article>
          <p>The C# language defines several data types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Primitive data types:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>int for integers.</li>
                <li>double for floating-point numbers.</li>
                <li>bool for true/false values.</li>
                <li>string for text.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Reference types, such as classes and arrays.</li>
          </ul>
          C# also supports nullable types, allowing variables to represent undefined values.
        </article>

      <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
        <header>if...else statement</header>
        <article>
          Use the if statement to execute a block of code if a condition is true. You can also use else to execute a block if the condition is false. An if statement looks like this:
          <code>if (condition) { /* statements */ } else { /* statements */ }</code>
          <p>
            C# allows for nested if statements and you can chain conditions using else if:
          </p>
          <code>if (condition1) { /* statements */ } else if (condition2) { /* statements */ } else { /* statements */ }</code>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header>while statement</header>
        <article>
          A while statement repeatedly executes its statements as long as the specified condition is true. It looks like this:
          <code>while (condition) { /* statements */ }</code> If the condition becomes false, the loop terminates.
          <p>
            For example, the following while loop increments a variable until it reaches three:
          </p>
          <code>int n = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; }</code>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
        <header>Function declarations</header>
        <article>
          A function in C# is defined using the method keyword, followed by the return type, name, and parameters:
          <ul>
            <li>The return type of the function.</li>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li>Optional parameters enclosed in parentheses.</li>
          </ul>
          For example:
          <code>public int Add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }</code>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Reference">
